# Pong
Pong with decent physics made without any graphics engines and from scratch

This was my first game i ever made just for fun :D
It has some decent physics, terrible graphics and a really bad structure :D

Mostly coded it during class because i was bored.

Controls:
- W/S: Up/Down for left paddle
- UpArrow/DownArray: Up/Down for right paddle
- Enter: Shoot ball
- Escape: Close program

Feel free to clone the code and improve it :)
